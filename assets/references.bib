abstract = {The Flexible Job Shop Problem is one of the most important NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Evolutionary computation has been widely used in research concerning this problem due to its ability for dealing with large search spaces and the possibility to optimize multiple objectives. Particle Swarm Optimization has shown good results, but algorithms based on this technique have premature convergence, therefore some proposals have introduced genetic operators or other local search methods in order to avoid the local minima. Therefore, this paper presents a hybrid and multi-objective algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization with Diversity (DIPSO), based on Particle Swarm Optimization along with genetic operators and Fast Non-dominated Sorting. Thus, to maintain a high degree of diversity in order to guide the search for a better solution while ensuring convergence, a new crossover operator has been introduced. The efficiency of this operator was tested in relation to the proposed objectives by using typical examples from literature. The results were compared to other studies that have shown good results by means Evolutionary Computation technique, for instance MOEA-GLS, MOGA, PSO + SA and PSO + TS.},

abstract = {The PSO algorithm can be physically interpreted as a stochastic damped mass-spring system: the so-called PSO continuous model. Furthermore, PSO corresponds to a particular discretization of the PSO continuous model. In this paper, we introduce a delayed version of the PSO continuous model, where the center of attraction might be delayed with respect to the particle trajectories. Based on this mechanical analogy, we derive a family of PSO versions. For each member of this family, we deduce the first and second order stability regions and the corresponding spectral radius. As expected, the PSO-family algorithms approach the PSO continuous model (damped-mass-spring system) as the size of the time step goes to zero. All the family members are linearly isomorphic when they are derived using the same delay parameter. If the delay parameter is different, the algorithms have corresponding stability regions of any order, but they differ in their respective force terms. All the PSO versions perform fairly well in a very broad area of the parameter space (inertia weight and local and global accelerations) that is close to the border of the second order stability regions and also to the median lines of the first order stability regions where no temporal correlation between trajectories exists. In addition, these regions are fairly similar for different benchmark functions. When the number of parameters of the cost function increases, these regions move towards higher inertia weight values (w=1) and lower total mean accelerations where the temporal covariance between trajectories is positive. Finally, the comparison between different PSO versions results in the conclusion that the centered version (CC-PSO) and PSO have the best convergence rates. Conversely, the centered-progressive version (CP-PSO) has the greatest exploratory capabilities. These features have to do with the way these algorithms update the velocities and positions of particles in the swarm. Knowledge of their respective dynamics can be used to propose a family of simple and stable algorithms, including hybrid versions.},

A class of deterministic machine scheduling problems has been introduced in the chapter. The chapter also deals with the single machine, parallel machine and multi-operation problems in this class, respectively. The two generalizations of the deterministic machine-scheduling model have been presented in the chapter. A deterministic scheduling model may give rise to various stochastic counterparts, as there is a choice in the parameters that are randomized, in their distributions, and in the classes of policies that can be applied. A characteristic feature of these models is that the stochastic parameters are regarded as independent random variables with a given distribution and that their realization occurs only after the scheduling decision has been made. In the deterministic model, one has perfect information, and capitalizing on it in minimizing the realization of a performance measure may require exponential time. {\textcopyright} 1993, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Finally, to analyze the convergence of DDPSO based on the solving of zero state response in discrete-time systems, we get its convergence condition and motion track of particles. As a result, we find that DDPSO has good convergence and diversity of swarm owing to environmental change gene which has randomicity and variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

The proposed scheme Dynamic-PSO (DPSO) does not disturb the fast convergence characteristics of PSO by keeping the basic concept of PSO unaffected. When particles personal best and swarm's global best position do not improve in successive generation i.e. start stagnating DPSO provides dynamicity to particles externally in such a manner that stagnated particles move towards potentially better unexplored region to maintain diversity as this increases chance to recover from stagnation. By identifying and curing stagnated particles, it also avoids the problems of getting trapped in local optima and premature convergence. We have compared the proposed algorithm DPSO with basic PSO and its widely accepted variants over 24 benchmark functions provided by Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB 2013).

abstract = {Adaptive inertia weight is proposed to rationally balance the global exploration and local exploitation abilities for particle swarm optimization. The resulting algorithm is called adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization algorithm (AIW-PSO) where a simple and effective measure, individual search ability (ISA), is defined to indicate whether each particle lacks global exploration or local exploitation abilities in each dimension. A transform function is employed to dynamically calculate the values of inertia weight according to ISA. In each iteration during the run, every particle can choose appropriate inertia weight along every dimension of search space according to its own situation. By this fine strategy of dynamically adjusting inertia weight, the performance of PSO algorithm could be improved. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AIW-PSO, comprehensive experiments were conducted on three well-known benchmark functions with 10, 20, and 30 dimensions. AIW-PSO was compared with linearly decreasing inertia weight PSO, fuzzy adaptive inertia weight PSO and random number inertia weight PSO. Experimental results show that AIW-PSO achieves good performance and outperforms other algorithms. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

The most important advantages of the PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The inertia weight (w) is one of PSO's parameters originally proposed by Shi and Eberhart to bring about a balance between the exploration and exploitation characteristics of PSO. Since the introduction of this parameter, there have been a number of proposals of different strategies for determining the value of inertia weight during a course of run. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of the various inertia weight strategies reported in the related literature. These approaches are classified and discussed in three main groups: constant, time-varying and adaptive inertia weights. A new adaptive inertia weight approach is also proposed which uses the success rate of the swarm as its feedback parameter to ascertain the particles' situation in the search space. The empirical studies on fifteen static test problems, a dynamic function and a real world engineering problem show that the proposed particle swarm optimization model is quite effective in adapting the value of w in the dynamic and static environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Scheduling problems received substantial attention during the last decennia. The job-shop problem is a very important scheduling problem, which is NP-hard in the strong sense and with well-known benchmark instances of relatively small size which attest the practical difficulty in solving it. The literature on the job-shop scheduling problem includes several approximation and exact algorithms. So far, no algorithm is known which solves the job-shop scheduling problem optimally with a lower complexity than the exhaustive enumeration of all feasible solutions. We propose such an algorithm, based on the well-known Bellman equation designed by Held and Karp to find optimal sequences and which offers the best complexity to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem known to this date. For the TSP this means O(n22n) which is exponentially better than O(n!) required to evaluate all feasible solutions. We reach similar results by first recovering the principle of optimality, which is not obtained for free in the case of the job-shop scheduling problem, and by performing a complexity analysis of the resulting algorithm. Our analysis is conservative but nevertheless exponentially better than brute force. We also show very promising results obtained from our implementation of this algorithm, which seem to indicate two things: firstly that there is room for improvement in the complexity analysis (we observe the generation of a number of solutions per state for the benchmark instances considered which is orders of magnitude lower than the bound we could devise) and secondly that the potential practical implications of this approach are at least as exciting as the theoretical ones, since we manage to solve some celebrated benchmark instances in processing times ranging from seconds to minutes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {One primary objective in solving the job shop scheduling problems is to minimize the makespan, which is a particularly hard combinatorial optimization problem. The problem has been known for years and a vast majority of researches had been focused to solve the problem using a variety of optimization methods such as the branch and bound (B{\&}B). However, the B{\&}B method is considered as only suitable for small and medium size problems due its prohibitive computational time. In this paper, we implement the B{\&}B method using the disjunctive programming approach to obtain optimal solutions for job shop scheduling problem. The B{\&}B program developed is tested on a set of benchmark data and the results obtain are compared to best known from the previous work. Based on the comparison, we conclude that the branch and bound algorithm is considerable as a solution tool for small, medium, as well as large job shop problems. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Flexible Job Shop Problem is a generalization of the classical job shop scheduling problem in which for every operation there is a group of machines that can process it. The problem is to assign operations to machines and to order the operations on the machines, so that the operations can be processed in the smallest amount of time. We present a linear time approximation scheme for the non-preemptive version of the problem when the number m of machines and the maximum number $\mu$ of operations per job are fixed. We also study the preemptive version of the problem when m and $\mu$ are fixed, and present a linear time (2 + $\epsilon$-approximation algorithm for the problem with migration. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000.},

Since many infamous combinatorial problems have been proved to be NP-complete, the latter alternative seems far more likely. In that sense, NP-completeness of a problem justifies the use of enumerative optimization methods and of approximation algorithms. In this paper we give an informal introduction to the theory of NP-completeness and derive some fundamental results, in the hope of stimulating further use of this valuable analytical tool. {\textcopyright} 1979, North-Holland Publishing Company.},

abstract = {The Flexible Job Shop Problem is one of the most important NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Evolutionary computation has been widely used in research concerning this problem due to its ability for dealing with large search spaces and the possibility to optimize multiple objectives. Particle Swarm Optimization has shown good results, but algorithms based on this technique have premature convergence, therefore some proposals have introduced genetic operators or other local search methods in order to avoid the local minima. Therefore, this paper presents a hybrid and multi-objective algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization with Diversity (DIPSO), based on Particle Swarm Optimization along with genetic operators and Fast Non-dominated Sorting. Thus, to maintain a high degree of diversity in order to guide the search for a better solution while ensuring convergence, a new crossover operator has been introduced. The efficiency of this operator was tested in relation to the proposed objectives by using typical examples from literature. The results were compared to other studies that have shown good results by means Evolutionary Computation technique, for instance MOEA-GLS, MOGA, PSO + SA and PSO + TS.},

abstract = {Most scheduling problems are complex combinatorial problems and very difficult to solve [Manage. Sci. 35 (1989) 164; F.S. Hillier, G.J. Lieberman, Introduction to Operations Research, Holden-Day, San Francisco, CA, 1967]. That is why, lots of methods focus on the optimization according to a single criterion (makespan, workloads of machines, waiting times, etc.). The combining of several criteria induces additional complexity and new problems. In this paper, we propose a Pareto approach based on the hybridization of fuzzy logic (FL) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP). This hybrid approach exploits the knowledge representation capabilities of FL [Fuzzy Sets Syst. 1 (1989)] and the adaptive capabilities of EAs. The integration of these two methodologies for the multi-objective optimization has become an increasing interest. The objective considered is to minimize the overall completion time (makespan), the total workload of machines and the workload of the most loaded machine. Many examples are presented to illustrate some theoretical considerations and to show the efficiency of the suggested methodology. {\textcopyright} 2002 IMACS. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Job-shop scheduling problem (abbreviated to JSP) is one of the well-known hardest combinatorial optimization problems. During the last three decades, the problem has captured the interest of a significant number of researchers and a lot of literature has been published, but no efficient solution algorithm has been found yet for solving it to optimality in polynomial time. This has led to recent interest in using genetic algorithms (GAs) to address it. The purpose of this paper and its companion (Part II: Hybrid Genetic Search Strategies) is to give a tutorial survey of recent works on solving classical JSP using genetic algorithms. In Part I, we devote our attention to the representation schemes proposed for JSP. In Part II, we will discuss various hybrid approaches of genetic algorithms and conventional heuristics. The research works on GA/JSP provide very rich experiences for the constrained combinatorial optimization problems. All of the techniques developed for JSP may be useful for other scheduling problems in modern flexible manufacturing systems and other combinatorial optimization problems.

Metaheuristics for decision making has attracted significant research and industry attention due to the increasing complexity of models and quick decision making requirements in the industry. Metaheuristics have been applied to food processing/production technologies including fermentation, thermal drying and distillation and other system wide optimization such as transportation, storage (warehousing), production planning and scheduling. In terms of metaheuristics algorithms, Genetic Algorithm and Differential Evolution are the most popular while other algorithms have also demonstrated their effectiveness in addressing various optimization problems. Most problems were typically formulated as single objective mathematical models constructed from experimental or collected data. Recently, multi-objective optimization is becoming more popular because it is able to consider problems from several perspectives and attain more practical results.},

abstract = {The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is a typical scheduling problem in practical production and has been proven to be a NP-hard problem. The study of FJSP is important to remarkably direct actual manufacturing processes. The paper proposes an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for solving FJSP and obtains beneficial solutions by improvement on encoding/decoding scheme, communication mechanism between particles, and alternate rules of candidate machines of operations. The innovation of encoding/decoding scheme proposes a novel designed chain encoding scheme and a corresponding effective decoding scheme. The chain-based encoding scheme can reasonably convert FJSP to an appropriate operation linked list and the novel designed decoding scheme owns the capacity of further explorering the solution space. The improvement of traditional PSO focuses on the innovation of information communication between particles, besides the modification of algorithm architecture. The amelioration of rules on operated machine selection is carried out based on the critical path of operations research (OR). It promotes algorithm efficiency by only alternating the candidate machines of operations on the critical path. In addition, much parameters tuning work is involved in a series of experiments. The study proposes some tuning schemes of parameters with exact mathematical methods, and these schemes can effectively help find more appropriate parameters. The final experiment results prove that the improved PSO exhibits remarkable ability to solve FJSP.},

Near-optimal trajectories in an energetic environment for underwater vehicles were computed using a numerical solution of a nonlinear optimal control problem (NOCP). An energy performance index as a cost function, which should be minimized, was defined. The resulting problem was a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). A genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms were applied to solve the resulting TPBVP. Applying an Euler-Lagrange equation to the NOCP, a conjugate gradient penalty method was also adopted to solve the TPBVP. The problem of energetic environments, involving some energy sources, was discussed. Some near-optimal paths were found using a GA, PSO, and ACO algorithms. Finally, the problem of collision avoidance in an energetic environment was also taken into account.},
